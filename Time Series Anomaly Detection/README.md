# time_series_anomaly_research
Time series anomaly detection algorithms done and learned from them with the report paper.
The data used in the project is from Nab (https://github.com/numenta/NAB). nyc_taxi data.
This refers to the passengers with having report for every 30 minutes. For a year.
For the project few anomaly detection algorithms tested via various libraries.
With the tests having some mistakes for the data points and actual anomaly points in my opinion f1 score test method not used.
These methods below used for the project:
Auto Encoder
Hotelling
Change Finder
Isolation Forest
Local Outlier Factor
One Class SVM
Z Score
